In this exercise, we use tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, etc) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2024winter/hw/hw1/hw1.html) and to build a cohort of ICU stays.

## Q1. Visualizing patient trajectory

Visualizing a patient's encounters in a health care system is a common task in clinical data analysis. In this question, we will visualize a patient's ADT (admission-discharge-transfer) history and ICU vitals in the MIMIC-IV data.

### Q1.1 ADT history

A patient's ADT history records the time of admission, discharge, and transfer in the hospital. This figure shows the ADT history of the patient with `subject_id` 10001217 in the MIMIC-IV data. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the type of event (ADT, lab, procedure). The color of the line segment represents the care unit. The size of the line segment represents whether the care unit is an ICU/CCU. The crosses represent lab events, and the shape of the dots represents the type of procedure. The title of the figure shows the patient's demographic information and the subtitle shows top 3 diagnoses.

![](10001217_adt.png) 

Do a similar visualization for the patient with `subject_id` 10013310 using ggplot.

Hint: We need to pull information from data files `patients.csv.gz`, `admissions.csv.gz`, `transfers.csv.gz`, `labevents.csv.gz`, `procedures_icd.csv.gz`, `diagnoses_icd.csv.gz`, `d_icd_procedures.csv.gz`, and `d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz`. For the big file `labevents.csv.gz`, use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make the Parquet folder `labevents_pq` available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link. Make your code reproducible.

**Answer:** Here I copy the Parquet format generated in Homework 2 to the current working directory `hw3` and renamed it as `labevents_pq`. Then I import the necessary data files and generate the visualization for the patient with `subject_id` 10013310.

```{r}

### Q1.2 ICU stays

ICU stays are a subset of ADT history. This figure shows the vitals of the patient `10001217` during ICU stays. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the value of the vital. The color of the line represents the type of vital. The facet grid shows the abbreviation of the vital and the stay ID.

![](10001217_icu.png)

Do a similar visualization for the patient `10013310`.

**Answer:** Here I generate the visualization for the patient with `subject_id` 10013310.

```{bash}
# Retrieve a subset of `chartevents.csv.gz` and `icustays` only containing patient 10013310
#| eval: false
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz | awk -F, 'NR == 1 ||

d_item <- d_items %>% 
  filter(abbreviation %in% c("HR", "NBPd", "NBPs", "Temperature F", "RR")) %>% 
  select(itemid, abbreviation)

d_item
```

```{r}

chartevents_d_10013310 <- events_10013310 %>%
  left_join(d_item, by = "itemid")

chartevents_d_10013310
```

```{r}
# draw the ICU vitals for patient 10013310 and put different vitals in different facets
plot <- ggplot(chartevents_d_10013310, aes(x = charttime, y = valuenum, color = abbreviation)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(abbreviation ~ stay_id, scales = "free", switch = "y") +
  labs(title = "Patient 10013310 ICU stays - Vitals") +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.grid = element_line(color = "gray", linewidth = 0.5),
        panel.border = element_rect(color = "grey", fill = NA, linewidth = 0.8),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 10)) +  # Adjust the size of facet titles
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) + 
  guides(color = FALSE)

ggsave("10013310_icu.png", plot, width = 8, height = 5)
```

The visualization for the patient with `subject_id` 10013310 is shown below.

**Answer:** There are 50920 unique `subject_id` and 12488 `subject_id` have multiple ICU stays. The number of ICU stays per `subject_id` is summarized by the following graph.

```{r}
# number of unique subject_id
icustays_tble %>% 
  distinct(subject_id) %>% 
  nrow()
```

```{r}
# whether a subject_id can have multiple ICU stays
icustays_tble %>% 
  count(subject_id) %>% 
  filter(n > 1) %>% 
  nrow()
```

```{r}
# number of ICU stays per subject_id
icustays_tble %>% 
  count(subject_id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Number of ICU stays per subject_id", 
       x = "Number of ICU stays", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10000))
```

## Q3. `admissions` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `admissions.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | head

  as_tibble() |>
  print(width = Inf)
```

### Q3.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize the following information by graphics and explain any patterns you see.

-   number of admissions per patient\
-   admission hour (anything unusual?)\
-   admission minute (anything unusual?)\
-   length of hospital stay (from admission to discharge) (anything unusual?)

According to the [MIMIC-IV documentation](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/about/concepts/#date-shifting),

> All dates in the database have been shifted to protect patient confidentiality. Dates will be internally consistent for the same patient, but randomly distributed in the future. Dates of birth which occur in the present time are not true dates of birth. Furthermore, dates of birth which occur before the year 1900 occur if the patient is older than 89. In these cases, the patient’s age at their first admission has been fixed to 300.

```{r}
# number of admissions per patient
admissions_tble %>% 
  count(subject_id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Number of admissions per patient", 
       x = "Number of admissions", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# admission hour
admissions_tble %>%
  mutate(admission_hour = hour(admittime)) %>%
  count(admission_hour) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = admission_hour, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Admission Hour", 
       x = "Admission Hour", 
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# admission minute
admissions_tble %>%
  mutate(admission_minute = minute(admittime)) %>%
  count(admission_minute) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = admission_minute, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Admission minute", 
       x = "Admission minute", 
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# length of hospital stay
admissions_tble %>% 
  mutate(length_of_stay = as.numeric(difftime(dischtime, admittime, units = "hours"))) %>% 
  count(length_of_stay) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = length_of_stay)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of length of hospital stay", 
       x = "Length of hospital stay (hour)", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Q4. `patients` data

Patient information is available in `patients.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz | head
```

### Q4.1 Ingestion

Import `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/>) as a tibble `patients_tble`.

```{r}
# import patients data
patients_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz") |> 
  as_tibble() |>
  print(width = Inf)
```

### Q4.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize variables `gender` and `anchor_age` by graphics, and explain any patterns you see.

```{r}
# Summary of gender
gender_summary <- patients_tble %>%
  count(gender) %>%
  mutate(percent = n / sum(n) * 100)

# Plot gender distribution
ggplot(gender_summary, aes(x = gender, y = percent, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Gender Distribution of Patients", x = "Gender", y = "Percentage") +
  theme_minimal()

# Summary of anchor_age
anchor_age_summary <- patients_tble %>%
  group_by(anchor_age) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

# Plot anchor_age distribution
ggplot(anchor_age_summary, aes(x = anchor_age, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Anchor Age", x = "Anchor Age", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Q5. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_labitems.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/d_labitems/>) is the dictionary of lab measurements.

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), and glucose (50931). Retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` that only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the last available measurement (by `storetime`) before the ICU stay. The final `labevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each lab measurement.

![](labevents_tble.png)

Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `labevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link.

```{r}
# import labevents and d_labitems data
labevents_tble <- labevents |> 
  dplyr::select(labevent_id, subject_id, itemid, storetime, valuenum) |> 
  dplyr::filter(itemid %in% c(50912, 50971, 50983, 50902, 50882, 51221, 51301, 50931))
d_labitems <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz")
```

```{r}
# restrict to the last available measurement (by `storetime`) before the ICU stay.
labevents_tble <- labevents_tble %>%
  group_by(subject_id, itemid) %>%
  filter(storetime == max(storetime)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
# merge labevents and d_labitems
labevents_item <- labevents_tble %>%
  left_join(d_labitems, by = "itemid")
```

```{r}
labevents_item %>% 
  distinct(subject_id) %>% 
  nrow()
```

```{r}
# The final `labevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each lab measurement.
labevents_tble <- labevents_item %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = label, values_from = valuenum)
```

```{r}
# merge the lines with the same subject_id
labevents_tble1 <- labevents_tble %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), ~ first(.)))

labevents_tble1
```

## Q6. Vitals from charted events

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `itemid` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `value` variable is the value measured for `itemid`. The first 10 lines of `chartevents.csv.gz` are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `itemid` in `chartevents.csv.gz`.

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate (220045), systolic non-invasive blood pressure (220179), diastolic non-invasive blood pressure (220180), body temperature in Fahrenheit (223761), and respiratory rate (220210). Retrieve a subset of `chartevents.csv.gz` only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the first vital measurement within the ICU stay. The final `chartevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each vital measurement.

![](chartevents_tble.png)

Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `chartevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory, for example, by a symbolic link.

## Q7. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble `mimic_icu_cohort` for all ICU stays, where rows are all ICU stays of adults (age at `intime` \>= 18) and columns contain at least following variables

-   all variables in `icustays_tble`\
-   all variables in `admissions_tble`\
-   all variables in `patients_tble`
-   the last lab measurements before the ICU stay in `labevents_tble`
-   the first vital measurements during the ICU stay in `chartevents_tble`

The final `mimic_icu_cohort` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each variable.

![](mimic_icu_cohort.png)

## Q8. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Summarize the following information about the ICU stay cohort `mimic_icu_cohort` using appropriate numerics or graphs:

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs demographic variables (race, insurance, marital_status, gender, age at intime)

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs the last available lab measurements before ICU stay

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs the average vital measurements within the first hour of ICU stay

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs first ICU unit
